# CSDC101-PHASE-2
Hello and welcome to my Phase 2 project in CSDC101 titled "Cocoyashi Arc: Keigan’s Journey"

# Overview

# How to run:
1. Download the .cpp file
2. Compile with any C++ compiler then run.
3. Enjoy.

# Extra notes:
I added one new skill called "Art of Resistance" which buffs player endurance by 50%. I already implemented it 
before reading that there was no need to add new skills or items. It already functions properly, hopefully it helps
with your survivability.
